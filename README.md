# Machine Learning Foundation

>   ​	In my opinion, unlike other ML courses which introduce lots of  different algorithms, 'Machine Learning Foundation' of professor Lin focus more **foundation** aspects about ML. This course won't (or won't first) tell you detail about a algorithm (such as SVM, Logistic Regression...). On the contrary, he illustrates **when, why, how** machine learning can work form a more macro perspective.

​	This is note and code for course [(Machine Learning Foundations)---Mathematical Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ntumlone-mathematicalfoundations/home/welcome). The notes are **not very detailed**, mainly **focus on parts that I didn't know much about before**. If you want more detailed notes,there is a more detailed notes [林轩田机器学习基石]([https://redstonewill.github.io/categories/%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E6%9E%97%E8%BD%A9%E7%94%B0%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E5%9F%BA%E7%9F%B3/](https://redstonewill.github.io/categories/机器学习/林轩田机器学习基石/)).

​	The notes (1_Introduce, 2_PLA, 3_why_can_learn, 4_learn_better) follow the order of course but are not one-to-one with weekly courses.

-   1_Introduce: week 1,3;
-   2_PLA: week 2;
-   3_why_can_learn: week 4,5,6;
-   4_learn_better: week 7,8. 

​	Homework (code) 0,1,2 are in `code` folder.
